This Was a real challenging project.
This took me around 4-5 days to research, create, update, modify the project.
During this time I just tried new methods and making it in a different and beautiful way.
Creating a web map through js or html was a bit easy as i created them for a sample database but i tried something new.
I create a web map using 'Python'.
It was I guess a new idea(atleast for me). Because only a few coders know about the folium and branca module of python.
I tried using it.
I read both of their Documentation.
And finally through many faliures I finally succed.
It was a pritty moment for me to make a web map using python.
This also shows that that's why python can be used in most of the projects.

USING THE web_map
1. I have already extracted the data.
2. So there's no need to modify the Extracter.py
3. Now for the main.py this is the main file
4. This file do all the processing using the following modules. 1. pandas, 2. folium, 3. branca, 4. os
5. to modify or add some objects one is suggested the to modify the file.
6. you may see at the last line of this file it is written to save the file in the HTML format.
7. Once your main.py is executed a map.html file will be created.
8. You may open it and the web map will appears.
