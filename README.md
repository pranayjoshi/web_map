# Details and usage
The data.csv file in this repo. is a web extracted database of OSGeo members.
the Extracter.py extracts the necessary data out of it, and saves it to main.csv.
But this while needs to be editted to be able to use it as a datafile for our project.
Some of the datasets needs to be deleted and editted.
now the main.py file executes the whole program and takes main.csv as a datafile.


Further details are provided in the files itself.
